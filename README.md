# GunadarmaXBRIN-at-SemEval-2023-task-12

This repository contains several codes used by our team when participating in [SemEval 2023 task 12](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7320). In short, task 12 on SemEval 2023 aims to do sentiment analysis on the African dataset. There are 3 tasks in task 12, such as monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot sentiment analysis. Our team participates in monolingual sentiment analysis of Xitsonga (track 12), multilingual sentiment analysis on 12 African languages (track 16), and zero-shot sentiment analysis of Oromo (track 18).

We utilize three models to deal with each track we follow, i.e., AfriBERTa, Support Vector Machine + One vs Rest (SVM + OvR), and SVM + OvR with SMOTE oversampling. Details and results of each model are reported in this [article](https://aclanthology.org/2023.semeval-1.120/).
